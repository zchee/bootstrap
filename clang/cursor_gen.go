/*
	A cursor representing some element in the abstract syntax tree for
	a translation unit.

	The cursor abstraction unifies the different kinds of entities in a
	program--declaration, statements, expressions, references to declarations,
	etc.--under a single "cursor" abstraction with a common set of operations.
	Common operation for a cursor include: getting the physical location in
	a source file where the cursor points, getting the name associated with a
	cursor, and retrieving cursors for any child nodes of a particular cursor.

	Cursors can be produced in two specific ways.
	clang_getTranslationUnitCursor() produces a cursor for a translation unit,
	from which one can use clang_visitChildren() to explore the rest of the
	translation unit. clang_getCursor() maps from a physical source location
	to the entity that resides at that location, allowing one to map from the
	source code into the AST.
